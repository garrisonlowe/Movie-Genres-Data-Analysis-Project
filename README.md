# Movie Genres Data Analysis Project
#### Here are some things I want to look at:

#### Research Questions (Q):

#### Research Hypotheses (H):
- The best movies according to vote avg. return high profits and revenue.
- The best movies according to popularity return high profit and revenue.
- Highly budgeted movies return high profit.
- Highly budgeted movies have a high popularity.
